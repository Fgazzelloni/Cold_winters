# Cold winters

This is the repo of the **Cold Winter** project by [*Kent Johnson*](https://github.com/kent37/Cold_winters).
If you would like to help out with suggestions please do that!

The repo contains 10 years of weather data for *Boston Logan Airport* from [**NOAA**](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/) to answer the question:

## Have extended cold snaps in Boston become rarer?

Inside you'll find:

- [code](https://github.com/kent37/Cold_winters/blob/main/Cold_spells_demo.R)
- [data ](https://github.com/kent37/Cold_winters/blob/main/Logan_weather_12-2012_3-2021.csv)

There are several time series plots made with {ggplot2} for analysing 10 years of weather data.
